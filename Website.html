        <h1>Agri Rentals</h1>
        <p>
            Agriculture forms the backbone of Indian economy and there is always a need of supporting and improving it .As a part of which some of Indian NGO's are with an initiative of supporting the farmers by facilitating them with the modern agricultural equipment's on rental basis .Modern agricultural equipment's make farmers work more efficient and easy .As a part of which there are some organizations that are set up to help those farmers who are in need of such equipment's ,where the organization owns the equipment's and rent those on request of farmers at liable amounts. At present, farmers need to travel to a place to borrow all the essential needs, which is a tiresome and not a cost-effective work. So, a smart digital farming is listed as the highest-ranking technology opportunity in the latest Global Opportunity report in terms of its expected positive impact on society. This paper is on digitizing the process of renting the agricultural equipment’s by the farmers .We aim at developing an application that farmers can use to get their equipment’s on rent and also check the availability and renting .We also allow them to book the equipment’s in advance .It also helps us to get the track of equipment’s that are on rent .We also aim at developing analytic for the state heads to make better availability of equipment’s and to keep track of the equipment’s as well, which could help in providing better support for farmers.
